      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <dl id="faq">
         <dt>What is the meaning of "bonsai"?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>The word "Bon-sai" is a Japanese term that literally translates to "planted in a container." The art of bonsai derives from an ancient Chinese horticultural practice, which was then redeveloped under the influence of Japanese Zen Buddhism.</p>
         </dd> 
         <dt>Why is a bonsai small?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>Several factors contribute to keeping bonsai small. The tree is grown in a container that limits the growth and extent of the roots. Trimming, pruning, and repotting also restrict growth. A shallow container limits the amount of soil and nutrients available. However, a properly managed bonsai will still maintain the characteristics of a fully grown tree.</p>
         </dd>         
         <dt>Can any tree be a bonsai?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>Yes, that's the beauty of bonsai! Bonsai is not a tree species; it's a combination of cultivation techniques that produce small trees mimicking the shape and scale of full-size trees in small containers. Popular species include Maples, Pines, and Junipers, but you may have your own favorites. You can find information on several different species on our <a href="#">website</a>.</p>
         </dd>          
         <dt>What type of bonsai should I get?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>The first decision is whether the bonsai will be indoors or outdoors. The most popular indoor bonsai are Ficus and Carmona trees. For outdoors, Maples, Pines, and Junipers are popular.</p>
            <p>If this is your first bonsai, the Ficus is an excellent choice for indoors, and the Juniper works well for outdoors. Both are resilient and forgiving!</p>
         </dd>
         <dt>How hard is it to care for a bonsai?</dt>         
         <dd>
            <p>Bonsai require more work than an ordinary houseplant. Indoor bonsai should be placed near a south-facing window with ample sunlight. Ficus and Carmona require relatively high humidity, so consider using a humidity tray. Place outdoor bonsai in bright spots with lots of light, and provide shade during extremely hot summers. Protect your trees from cold and frost in winter.</p>
            <p>Watering is crucial for your bonsai's health. The frequency depends on the species, season, soil mixture, climate, and pot size. Research your species' watering needs to ensure a healthy tree.</p>
         </dd>  
         <dt>How often should I water my bonsai?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>Avoid a fixed watering schedule. Instead, monitor the topsoil; when it begins to dry out, water thoroughly to ensure the entire root mass is wetted.</p>
         </dd> 
         <dt>How do I keep my bonsai free of disease and insects?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>Bonsai are susceptible to insect attacks and disease. Keep your bonsai healthy by providing ample light, fresh air, and ventilation. Keep the soil free of decaying material and use proper watering techniques.</p>
            <p>To prevent insects, consider using an insecticidal soap spray, which is safe for humans and animals. Multiple applications may be necessary; a weekly spray is often recommended.</p>
         </dd>         
         <dt>How old can bonsai get?</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>If properly cared for, bonsai can outlive fully grown trees in nature. Some mountain-born bonsai live over 800 years, often passed down through generations in Japanese nurseries. The oldest known bonsai is a Ficus tree in Crespi, Italy, estimated to be over 1000 years old!</p>
            <p>Your bonsai could become a family heirloom cherished by future generations.</p>
